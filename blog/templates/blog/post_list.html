            <h2><a href="">Linux, the Game Changer!!</a></h2>
            <p>For years all of my computers ran some version of Windows. I never knew of any other alternatives to be honest which really didn't bother me much because all I really used my computer for was to browse the web, check my email and play World of Warcraft. Earlier this year I bought a new computer mainly because I started playing this new P.C. game called Wildstar and my old computer didn't have enough processing power and a good enough graphics card. So I went out and bought one of those I7's with 12 GB's of RAM, a 3 TB hard drive, and a pretty decent graphics card. After buying this computer I started researching on how I can properly protect it so that I don't screw it up by infecting it with some virus after installing a new program on downloads.com and this Linux OS kept coming up. One article said that the best way to protect your new computer was to uninstall Windows and go install a Linux distribution. So I did what I usually do when something sparks my interest and went onto YouTube and typed "Linux" into the search box. I was immediately intrigued by Linux because of the command line interface that I always remember seeing in my favorite "Hacker" movies. I watched a few videos on how to install Linux, which was no easy task I might add, and decided to give it a shot and install it on the old computer that I had just replaced. I first installed <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a> on it because Ubuntu seemed to be the most popular and the most "newb" friendly Linux distribution out there. I was absolutely hooked the first moment I typed "sudo apt-get update" into the terminal window. All those lines of text running down my screen made me feel like I was some sort of computer hacker. I know it sounds stupid but I instantly felt like I was part of some secret underground society of expert computer users. The more I read and learned about Linux, the more hooked I became and before you know it, I hadn't turned my new computer on or even played any of my beloved video games in months. This was the beginning of something new and exciting for me and I instantly started taking an enormous interest in computers from this point on. This was actually what had led me to consider a career change and ultimately an interest in Data Science to begin with. I love the whole "<a href="http://opensource.org/">Open Source</a>" initiative that Linux was founded on and I love the control you can have over your computer once you start learning about how Linux works under the hood. Since installing Ubuntu on my old computer I have installed several other Linux distributions like <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/">Fedora</a>, <a href="http://linuxmint.com/">Linux Mint</a>, <a href="http://www.archlinux.org/">Arch Linux</a>, and <a href="https://www.opensuse.org/en/">openSUSE</a>. Each distribution has its own special traits and I now have Mint on my main computer, Arch on my old computer and Ubuntu on my laptop. I have all but abandoned Windows for the most part but I did decide to dual boot Mint with Windows on my main computer mainly so I can still play World of Warcraft from time to time. My favorite distribution is Arch these days because I love the rolling distribution philosophy and I love the arch user repositories. I prefer having the latest and greatest "bleeding edge" software and I enjoyed building my Arch install from scratch. The most amazing thing about Linux though is the enormous community that has arisen from it. When I first started using Linux I had some problems getting it up and running and I also had some scary moments where I thought my computer was destroyed but there was always plenty of people out there on the forums  willing to help. The philosophy behind Linux encourages people to contribute in any way they can and to always help a new Linux user in need of some guidance. Don't get me wrong, like any other online community, there are always a few bad seeds that will occasionally discourage you and make you feel like you don't belong but those people are far and few between. If you are sick of paying for software, unintentionally downloading annoying computer virus's, and sub par performance speeds then you should definitely give Linux a shot. I promise you that you will not be disappointed and you might just learn a thing or two in the process.</p>

            <h2><a href="">My First Programming Language!!!</a></h2>
            <p>It has become very obvious to me that the first step that I need to take in order to learn more about the field of Data Science is to start learning how to program. The two most popular programming languages that are used in Data Science are Python and the R Programming Language. I decided to start off with Python because Python seems to be one of the most popular programming languages out there and from what I have read it is one of the easier programming languages to learn. I was a little nervous about having to take this step because learning how to program can be very intimidating to someone who has no prior experience in computer science. Luckily for me I was able to find several great resources online that really made the entire process painless. I enrolled in an online course on the Coursera website called “Programming for Everybody” which was taught by Dr. Charles "Chuck" Severance. This was my first experience taking an online course of any kind and I must admit that I was rather impressed. I have since enrolled in several other Coursera courses on all kinds of different subjects, in addition to a few other courses on sites like Udacity, MIT's OpenCourseWare, and edx. Sites like these are revolutionizing the field of Education not only by providing 100% free online courses that can be taken from the comfort of your home and at your own pace, but they are also being taught by some of the leading figures in each respective field of study. The course taught by Dr. Severance was geared towards absolute beginners so I was able to follow along pretty easily. Each week there was a new lesson added to the course's main website which included a set of videos that ran about 60-90 minutes long followed by one or two practice problems and a 10 question quiz. There was a book that you can download for free on the class website as well but I hardly even read it. The one thing I really loved about this class (and all online classes from what I've seen) was the class forum that was made available where I was able to go and ask other students questions about the lectures and get help on the practice problems when needed. Overall the class was tremendously helpful and allowed me to learn the basic fundamentals of Python. From there I decided to give Codeacademy a shot which ended up being another great resource for learning how to code. Codeacademy has an entire class dedicated to Python and it takes on a slightly different approach. On Codeacademy you learn by actually writing code into an interpreter that is provided by the website and then running the code to make sure the code was written correctly. This course was challenging at times but I was able to get through it with some help on the class forums and a Google search from time to time. After completing the course I started feeling pretty confident in my ability to understand Python syntax and some of the major built in features of Python such as lists, dictionaries, classes, etc. My last stop was another free online course taught by Professor David Evans on Udacity's website called “Introduction to Computer Science”. This course was tougher then the previous two courses but what was really cool about this course was that you learned how to program in Python by actually building a web crawler application. I was able to understand and follow along a little easier then I probably would have if I hadn't already taken the previous two courses. This course taught me more about what goes on behind the scenes with computer programs and how computer programs are structured. I had a ton of fun building the web crawler and I learned so much more about computers in general. I am pretty proud with how far have I have come in such a short period of time. I was also surprised to learn that I actually have a knack for coding which I can attribute to my good problem solving skills and my love for math. Learning Python has opened my eyes to a whole new world and I am eager to continue my journey.</p>

            <h2><a href="">Data Science Learning Paths</a></h2>
            <p>I was searching around the web today and I came across an excellent website that provides a free learning path for anyone interested in learning more about the field of Data Science. The website I am referring to is called The Open Source Data Science Masters and it provides a well structured curriculum for learning Data Science using nothing but free and open-source tools. The curriculum is broken up into sections which list several different "core competencies" that are necessary in learning Data Science. Each section refers to several different free online courses that are made available at websites like Coursera, Udacity, and a few publicly made courses from institutions like Stanford and The University of Washington. There are also several different free ebooks that are referenced throughout the curriculum in addition to other open source learning tools such as GitHub and Stack Overflow. The curriculum is challenging and I am guessing that it would take a great deal of time and hard work to get through the whole thing but if you are looking for an itemized list of specific skills that you will need to learn and the free tools and resources to learn them this is the place for you. I also wanted to add that there is another great learning path that is similar to the one mentioned in this post that can be found here on the very popular sliderule website. Please let me know what you think about these learning paths and if you have any other suggestions I would love to know more about it.</p>

            <h2><a href="">Data Science Sparks My Interest</a></h2>
            <p>I was looking online and found a website for a Data Science program at Syracuse called the I-school. I've been doing a lot of research lately into the field of Data Science and I really find it fascinating. Data Science encompasses a long list of skill sets and is not an easy field to break into. The Harvard Business Review recently posted an article called "Data Science: The Sexiest job of the 21st Century"  which points out that "the shortage of data scientists is becoming a serious restraint in some sectors." From what I have read so far you need to know how to program and be familiar with programming languages such as Python, R, and you also need to be highly skilled in statistics, linear algebra, and multivariable Calculus. Recently I took a Coursera course on Python called "Programming for Everybody (Python)" and I really enjoyed it. I have decided to dive deeper into the field of Data Science and I am going to continue to take online courses on some of the subjects that pertain to this field. The multivariable calculus scares me a bit after taking a look at an MIT OpenCourseWare lecture from the Multivariable Calculus  class taught by Prof Denis Auroux. I was rather disheartened after the video ended but it is important to keep in mind that this is a course taught at MIT and it's been awhile since I have taken any kind of calculus class. It will probably be a good idea for me to maybe take a refresher course on calculus and then maybe move onto single variable calculus before taking another look at the multivariable Calculus course. I am also going to look for a good statistics course and continue learning more about Python and then R. My main goal here is to fill in some of the pre-requisites before moving on to some actual Data Science courses. Ultimately, I would love to be able to apply for a Data Science boot camp where I can get some in person training. This will be no easy task but if I stay focused and work hard at it, the possibilities will be endless given that Data Science is in such high demand.</p>
